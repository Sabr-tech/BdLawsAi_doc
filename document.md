```sql
-- Users (handled by Supabase Auth)
-- Query History
create table query_history (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users,
  query text,
  response text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

# There are 2 architecture. We will be focusing on the quick and easier one instead of making it customized fully.
1. traditional acrhitecture
2. simplified architecture

we will be chosing 2.
Here is the architecture of both:
